# PUI89 AI HOME — AI Home Assistant Robot

## Commercial readiness progress

**28% — evidence-based commercial-readiness estimate**  
**Target: 100% = ready for an appropriately scoped commercial release or formal commercial procurement submission.** This is not a code-completion percentage, a sales forecast, or a claim of product certification. Scores are provisional and based on the evidence currently documented in this repository; they must be revised when new evidence is verified.

The repository establishes product identity, requirements, software contracts and early adapter/test foundations. No completed robot, real sensor integration, validated model, certified alarm function or real-world safety performance is established.

| Readiness gate | Weight | Evidence credit |
|---|---:|---:|
| Product purpose & requirements | 10 | 8 |
| Architecture & engineering design | 10 | 8 |
| Working software baseline | 15 | 4 |
| Reproducible tests & evaluation | 15 | 3 |
| Integrated product prototype | 15 | 0 |
| Safety, reliability & real-world validation | 15 | 1 |
| Licensing, IP & regulatory readiness | 10 | 3 |
| Commercial release package & support | 10 | 1 |
| **Total** | **100** | **28** |

**What 100% requires:** a defined product and acceptance criteria; integrated release candidate; reproducible performance and reliability evidence; appropriate safety and real-world validation; verified rights/licences and applicable regulatory conformity; manufacturing/deployment, pricing, warranty, maintenance, user documentation and support arrangements. A score of 100% is awarded only after all applicable release gates are evidenced and reviewed. Partner or research discussions may happen earlier, but must be labelled as development-stage collaboration—not a ready-to-sell product.

**Next commercial-readiness gate:** close the missing evidence above, beginning with project-specific working-product validation and safety evidence. Never count a planned feature, concept image, tool inventory, synthetic-only result or unrun test as a completed gate.

_Last readiness review: 7 November 2026. This estimate can rise or fall as evidence changes._

### An Indoor Mobile Assistant for Home Safety, Monitoring and Everyday Support

**A calmer, more understandable view of home conditions.**

PUI89 AI HOME is a dedicated indoor mobile assistant concept focused on home safety, environmental monitoring and everyday support. It uses a compact four-wheel design and remains a separate product from PUI89 AI NOMAD, which is intended for outdoor mobility, travel and carrying assistance.

- **Project:** PUI89 AI HOME
- **Product type:** AI Home Assistant Robot
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Pui89/AI-HOME
- **Website:** [English](https://pui89.github.io/home.html) · [ภาษาไทย](https://pui89.github.io/home-th.html)
- **Related but independent product:** [PUI89 AI NOMAD](https://github.com/Pui89/AI-NOMAD)

## Product purpose

HOME is intended to help residents understand changes and possible hazards inside a home or small building. It is a software-first, evidence-led concept; it is not a certified alarm, building inspector or replacement for qualified professionals.

Research areas include:
- Water leaks, moisture and humidity changes
- Smoke, abnormal heat and fire-related warning evidence
- Electrical anomaly indicators, without operating breakers or wiring
- Visible cracks and vibration/change observations, without claiming structural diagnosis
- Mold-risk conditions based on environmental evidence
- Sound, light, temperature and other environmental changes
- Clear reports showing what is known, unknown, changed, uncertain and worth checking

## Indoor robot concept — proposed requirements

| Parameter | Proposed target |
|---|---|
| Form | Compact four-wheel indoor mobile robot |
| Complete weight target | 8 kg |
| Absolute maximum complete weight | 10 kg |
| Environment | Indoor homes and buildings |
| Mobility | Four protected wheels; low-speed supervised movement |
| Safety | Soft perimeter bumper, obstacle/drop-off awareness, safe stop on uncertainty |
| Privacy | Minimal collection; avoid unnecessary video, face recognition and conversation recording |

The 8 kg target and 10 kg maximum include the battery, sensors, computer, enclosure and accessories. They are engineering requirements, not measured prototype specifications.

## Shared intelligence, independent products

HOME may reuse versioned PUI89 AI Core contracts and services:
- WorldState, Observation, ActionProposal and FailureReport
- Evidence provenance, freshness and sensor-health checks
- Uncertainty propagation and conflict/missing-data handling
- Human-reviewed recommendations and safety gates
- Reproducible tests and machine-readable reports

HOME and NOMAD must keep separate mechanical designs, navigation, sensor configurations, operating environments, risk assessments and validation evidence.

## Safety and privacy boundaries

- Certified smoke, fire, carbon-monoxide and electrical protection devices remain primary.
- Never delay evacuation or emergency procedures for AI analysis.
- HOME must not operate locks, breakers, valves, cooking appliances or certified alarms.
- Stop when localization, obstacle evidence or battery state is uncertain.
- Do not claim fire detection, structural diagnosis, electrical fault diagnosis or hazard prevention without appropriate evidence and independent validation.
- Minimize personal data and provide clear owner control.

## Development status

**FOUNDATION / CONCEPT / NOT VALIDATED.** This repository establishes the HOME product identity and requirements. No completed robot, real sensor integration, trained model, certified alarm function or real-world safety performance is claimed.

The development sequence is: requirements and hazard analysis → software contracts and deterministic synthetic scenarios → tests and evidence reports → simulation → reviewed sensor integration only when resources, licences, security and costs are approved.

## local-first and supply-chain policy

External services and model downloads require prior technical, licensing, security and resource review. PUI89 excludes Chinese-origin AI models, providers and model-hosting services from its approved stack.

## Hugging Face vision models — opt-in local integration

This repository now includes real Hugging Face checkpoint adapters in [`pui89_models/hf_vision.py`](pui89_models/hf_vision.py), with project-specific usage boundaries in [`docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md).

- **OWLv2:** `google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble` for text-conditioned object proposals.
- **Intel DPT-Hybrid:** `Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas` for relative scene depth where appropriate; not calibrated distance or physical depth.
- **local-first default:** no packages or model weights are installed/downloaded automatically; CPU-only inference, local cache only by default, no hosted inference API or cloud GPU.
- **Evidence status:** adapter code is added; model inference and project-specific accuracy are NOT YET TESTED. Outputs remain uncertain observations for human review, never actuator commands.
